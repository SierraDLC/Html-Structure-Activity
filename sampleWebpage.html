    <h1>Strawberries are pretty tasty</h1>
    <p>I can <i>remember</i> the first time I had a strawberry.</p>
    <h2> I want some right now</h2>
    <p>Strawberry <small>ice</small> cream makes me quite happy. Sometimes I eat it for breakfast because I'm adult now. Cereal is <b>overrated</b>.</p>
    <h3>I forgot to pack my strawberries and i'm <mark>annoyed.</mark></h3>
    <p>When I was a child, I went <Strong>strawberry picking</Strong>. I didn't enjoy it because it was hot. <ins>I would probably go again</ins> as an adult but if it's hot, meh.</p>
